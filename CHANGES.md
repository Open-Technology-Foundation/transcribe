  - `transcribe_pkg/core/` - Core functionality
  - `transcribe_pkg/utils/` - Utilities
  - `transcribe_pkg/cli/` - Command line interfaces
- Consolidated duplicate files
- Standardized naming conventions
- Created proper module documentation and docstrings
- Improved command-line interface

## Performance Improvements

- Added parallel processing for audio chunks

## Migration Guide

1. Install the refactored package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Use the new command wrappers:
   - `transcribe_new` instead of `transcribe`
   - `clean-transcript_new` instead of `clean-transcript`
   - `create-sentences_new` instead of `create-sentences`
   - `language-codes_new` instead of `language-codes`

3. After testing, rename the new scripts to replace the old ones:
   ```bash
   mv transcribe_new transcribe
   mv clean-transcript_new clean-transcript
   mv create-sentences_new create-sentences
   mv language-codes_new language-codes
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Add comprehensive testing
- Add CI/CD pipeline
- Implement caching mechanism
- Add streaming transcription option
- Improve configuration management with config files
