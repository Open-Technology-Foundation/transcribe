Hello Elfie, are you there? I can't hear you. How about this? That's better. Better? And Rupert's here too. Oh my goodness. Very punctual. Absolutely. Look at you, I have to stare at you a bit. Still alive, huh? Yes, yes. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Oh good, good.

So, what has been happening? Apparently. What has been happening? How long has it been since we last spoke? How long? Let's see. It might be over a year. A bit over a year. It was around this time last year, wasn't it? Yeah, about that. I can't quite recall. I'll figure it out. Find the last Zoom meeting, we could figure that out. We should be able to work it out by the length of your beard, Carolyn. Well, it stays very much the same. My hair actually stops growing. Well, I think. I never have to trim anything, I just let it go.

There's actually a, what is it, the Sikhs? I think it's the Sikhs that never cut their hair. It's part of their dharma not to cut their hair. So I've sort of adopted that. So I never cut it, never do anything, I just let it sort of do its thing, you know. Letting my free flag fly. I like that. Let it do its thing. Yes. That's a fitting dharma concept. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, I've been letting my hair grow for a long time, but it seems to have no effect at all. Yeah. Well, you know, keep hoping. Yeah.

See, that's one of the first things that impressed me when I went on to the Heidegger kind of introduction into Heidegger thinking. You have zero, like a man and this guy summing him up. And he gives this example of you might go bald, a man goes bald, you know. He has no control over this whatsoever, of course. But what he does have control over is how he interprets that thing, you know. He might go and kill himself to invent a career of being a lover like Yul Brynner or being magnificent. Or like North Korean style, might make everyone else in the country shave their hair, you know, so that it doesn't stand out. I think that's, yeah. The megalomania. Yeah. I mean, we have examples of all of that in the world very well. We certainly do at the moment. Yes, at the moment. Yeah. There's a few things going on. Strange. External factors sort of starting to develop.

I've actually been rather distressed by what I've been hearing and seeing about what's happening in the UK. And I don't know how, I mean, maybe it's my particular news feeds and other things that are affecting my perspective. But, you know, it seems pretty crook. It doesn't seem very healthy at all. I mean, is that just my being overly negative or are things really that bad? Well, are they? In what way are they bad, I suppose? I guess I'm focusing on homelessness, on poverty, on those sorts of things. I guess they're the sort of things that I do sort of, you know, orient myself towards. So I just seem to get a constant stream of, especially in my YouTube type of feeds, of just, you know, how crook things are in the UK, how people are just up and leaving.

It seems like my perspective is being influenced by various factors, but it does appear that things are not very healthy at all. Am I being overly negative, or are things really that bad? I'm focusing on issues like homelessness and poverty, which are the areas I tend to orient myself towards. I constantly see content, especially in my YouTube feeds, about how dire things are in the UK, with people leaving for Southeast Asia because they can't afford to live there anymore. Is my perspective skewed by the YouTube algorithm, or is this really happening?

It doesn't seem noticeably worse than it has been. In fact, it might be better in terms of homelessness because we have a government that cares a bit more now. Regarding poverty, with a less right-wing government, it might improve slightly in the future. There's a lot of negative press, but that's always been the case, especially from the right-wing press. In terms of YouTube channels, I don't know. It sounds very specific and niche because the right-wing press wouldn't focus on poverty or homelessness. My feeds are from the BBC and The Guardian, which don't present these issues in the same way.

Walking around places like Hastings or London, things don't seem better than they have been. However, one hopes the government will address these issues. We've been left with a mess, and there's no doubt it's in a worse state than it has been for a long time. Many institutions are worse off. On the other hand, the NHS, despite being run down, still provides remarkable care. My son-in-law works for the NHS, and while it's difficult, it's not unmanageable. I spoke to someone whose partner had serious operations through the NHS, and the level of care was impressive.

It's anecdotal, but if you're young, it might be challenging. I'm thinking about my children and the young people I know here, and I don't see the same level of difficulty. What's your perspective, Alfie?

My partner had some serious operations and was going in for more. The level of care and speed of operation was remarkable. I asked if it was private, and he said, no, it was all NHS. It's anecdotal, but I suspect if you're young, it might be difficult. I'm thinking of my children and the young people I know here. I don't see that difficulty. What's your perspective, Alfie?

Pretty much like you, I'm not aware of anything going terribly wrong now. There's not much improvement either, and one wonders how much can be done in this situation. I don't sense huge unrest in the population. In my news feeds, similar stories come up about Germany. I hear that Germany is in terrible trouble and there's a deep crisis because they just had elections. But from what I know from my family there, everyone is just living as usual.

How is it in Indonesia, Gary? Are people just living?

Well, yeah, I think Indonesia isn't caught up in the same dramas as Western countries. There are demonstrations going on at the moment, with students back on the streets, which is good to see. In terms of everyday life, I don't think we've been as affected as many other countries. We have a different economy that isn't in lockstep with Western economies. I haven't noticed anything significant, although there are a few danger signals on the horizon. Otherwise, there's very little crime here. You don't fear for your safety in Indonesia, anywhere. You can feel safe.

When I was in the UK, I've only been there twice, but I didn't feel completely safe. Maybe it was just my unfamiliarity. Even in Australia, you're always sort of looking over your shoulder. You don't get that in Southeast Asia generally, but certainly in Indonesia. You can feel safe, whether that's justified or not is another question. I've never really felt unsafe here, unlike in some other countries. It might have been my unfamiliarity with Europe and the UK that led to that feeling.

Even in Australia, there's a sense of always looking over your shoulder, wondering what others are up to. You don't really experience that in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. You can feel safe here, whether that's justified or not is another question. I've never felt unsafe in Indonesia, unlike in some other countries. My unfamiliarity with Europe and the UK might have contributed to feeling unsafe there. It's hard to be completely objective because I haven't spent enough time there to know it well.

In Europe, there's a kind of breathlessness and addiction to drama. People are constantly looking for the next big news story. You turn on the radio in the morning, waiting for the latest headline from figures like Trump or Musk. If nothing dramatic happens, it feels like the day hasn't started. I've noticed this expectation and desire for drama in myself. Ordinary life seems boring, and the media capitalizes on this by focusing on dramatic storytelling to get views.

If Indonesia is escaping this trend, then that's a positive. While there are other issues like poverty, it's not as severe as in some other countries. People are generally well-fed and not struggling as much. I've been living in Bali for over a year and haven't traveled much outside the country, so I haven't seen what's happening in Jakarta or other places in Indonesia.

There's a constant pursuit of drama, and I find myself seeking it out, especially in developments like AI. It's a nonstop freight train, and keeping up is essential. AI has become highly politicized. For instance, there's DeepSeek, the Chinese AI, which has caused significant concern. It's essentially a clone and is available for free.

I certainly seek out developments in AI to some extent. Trying to keep up with AI is nonstop; it's like a freight train. You can't avoid keeping up, and it is very much tied to politics. AI has become extremely politicized. Have you heard about DeepSeek, the Chinese AI? It's caused a lot of consternation because it's essentially a clone. It's free, and you can download it onto your own machine and run it yourself, provided you have a good server. It's open source, so you can just grab it, although there are limitations.

It's interesting that there's this egalitarian Chinese version, which is not what we would typically assume, as we might expect it to be more state-controlled. It is sensitive in terms of Chinese content, but you can easily fix that by downloading one of their models and adjusting the system prompt. If you visit their DeepSeek website, you can access it if you don't have a machine capable of running these models. In that setting, you might get biased results, but the system itself has various levels. I've only been able to run the 32 billion parameter model, while the real model goes up to about 670 billion parameters. I don't have a machine that can run that, as I only have one GPU.

A GPU is something you put into your computer to accelerate the running of AI neural nets. I have one in my server in Jakarta, which cost about $25,000, and I can barely run the 70 billion parameter models. In comparison, people like Elon Musk have hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Despite this, you can still run these models. The political aspect is that they cloned an OpenAI model, one of their premium reasoning models called O1, for about $6 million, compared to the billions OpenAI spent developing it. Now there's a conflict, particularly from the US, banning the use of DeepSeek in any form and cutting off high-performing GPUs to China. Despite this, they used their old GPUs and cloned it anyway.

Premium models, such as the O1 reasoning model, have been developed at a fraction of the cost compared to the billions spent by OpenAI. This has led to tensions, particularly with the US banning the use of DeepSeek and restricting the sale of high-performing GPUs to China. Despite these restrictions, older GPUs have been used to clone these models, making them more accessible to tech enthusiasts.

While there is a wealth of information on AI development, its impact on everyday life has not been as dramatic as expected. In some industries, like advertising, jobs are being lost due to AI's ability to easily create text. However, the broader impact on global employment remains uncertain. Historically, technology has always displaced some jobs, but it often leads to new opportunities. If a job can be done better by a machine, it might not have been a fulfilling role to begin with.

Creative jobs, such as novel writing, are less likely to be affected, as AI lacks true creativity. However, advancements in large language models and reasoning models suggest that AI is approaching a level where it can mimic creative processes. While the full potential of AI is yet to be realized, significant developments are occurring, even if they are not immediately visible.

You might be surprised at what's been developed. The AI is still in its early stages. At this point, large language models combined with reasoning models have reached a point where you could say a creative process is happening. By this time next year, we'll see even more developments. A lot of things are happening that people aren't seeing, and many tasks are now greatly assisted by AI.

I can see how AI can handle a lot of legwork and number crunching, which is what technology has always done. However, I can't see it replacing the unique contributions of humans, like those of novelists, composers, artists, and sculptors. There's so much happening week after week in AI, and many products are still in development. A lot has happened under the surface that people aren't perceiving, and certainly, many people have lost jobs. Copywriting is an obvious example, as it's largely obsolete now. Even in editing, AI is being used more as an assistant to accelerate tasks.

In fields like artwork, animation, and movies, things are progressing rapidly. We might see full feature films being developed with AI assistance. CGI has been around for a long time, but it's not the same. CGI requires direction and takes a long time to render, whereas AI generation is incredibly fast. Technologies are getting faster, and I would be intrigued to see an AI-directed film that is indistinguishable from a human-directed one. When that happens, I'll be convinced. I can see AI's potential in blockbuster films like Marvel movies, but not yet in the types of films I would personally want to see.

We had a power cut due to the wind, but we're back now.

I would be intrigued to see an AI-directed film and not be able to tell that it's AI-directed. I suppose when that happens, then I'll accept it. But I just cannot see it. I can see it in terms of something like a Marvel movie or a Spider-Man film. But in terms of what I would consider a movie I'd want to go and see, I'm not sure.

We had a power cut. It's very windy here, and it just conked out. Have you talked about all the important stuff now? What's been happening in Elfie World? Oh gosh, I had a hell of a year, actually. My Johnny, my beloved, had cancer. So, the whole of last year, he was dealing with that. He had surgery, radiotherapy, and lots of other treatments. At the moment, he's just coming out of our total involvement in that, and it's looking okay.

How is Lynn? Oh, she's fine. I think she's decided to adjust her medication as she thinks fit, not necessarily what the doctors say. I don't think she needs very much at all, so she's good.

And are all your beloveds all right, Gary? Let's go through them. Yes, a lot has happened in a year. It's been overwhelming in some cases, but in general, they're all doing fine. I have to do a round of visits to children in various parts. I've got to go down to Melbourne where I have a daughter doing university. She is autistic, so she's having issues adjusting to Australia. She's been there nearly two years, and I think she's gradually finding her feet, although still a little overwhelmed by the culture. She's studying at university, which is completely new to her because education in Indonesia is nothing like it is in Australia. It's a completely different culture in terms of learning.

Did I mention I've got a new grandchild? My daughter in Jakarta, who was in Australia but moved back, is married to my senior accountant who is running the company now. She had a baby boy about five months ago, so that's an addition. That's grandchild number four.

How's your youngest son? He's as good as ever. He can do no wrong, of course. I think he's adjusting socially. He's doing okay, not badly. He likes being around other kids but doesn't really crave it. Anyway, that's just my perception. Otherwise, he's just fine. How old is he now? He's seven.

She had a baby boy about five months ago, so that's an addition to the family. That's grandchild number four. How's your youngest son? He's as good as ever. I mean, he can do no wrong, of course. I think he's adjusting socially. He's doing okay, not badly. He likes being around other kids but doesn't really crave it or seek it out. That's just my perception. Otherwise, he's just fine. How old is he now? He's seven. Well, he's as old as since we've met. Ananda was born slightly before I came to the course. Those photographs were amazing. I hope they jogged some memories. I didn't realize anyone was taking photographs. I'd seen some of the garden, but I hadn't seen any others. I was trying to remember all the people in the photos. I was a bit sneaky about how I took them because I can't remember anyone going around snapping. I couldn't even remember if we had mobile phones then. Yes, we did, with cameras.

And Rupert, you got a new grandchild? I didn't know that. I think he must have been born last time. We have them twice a week, and it's quite hard. When we had one, it wasn't too bad because there are two of us to share the responsibility. But with two, you can't really. All day long, you have to be with one or the other. They're lovely, but it can be a bit boring. If they could play chess, that would be all right. We could sit down and have a game. I'm trying to teach him noughts and crosses just to get started, but he's not interested in that either. Jigsaws are okay because the elder one, who's three and a half, likes doing them, but his attention span isn't great. It's odd because he used to get very involved in things, which was nice. He could sit and look after himself, but now he moves quickly from one thing to another. 

They're both very nice, and it's interesting because they're siblings but very different. The elder one, Marlow, is very engaged, with a short attention span, constantly doing things, and very bright. Jesse is lovely, but he's only one and a bit. He's very different. I remember when Marlow was his age, he'd get books for us to read, but there's nothing like that with Jesse. He's a very different character. I have three brothers, and there were similarities between all of us. It's early days, obviously.

They're siblings, but remarkably different in their approach to life. The elder one, Marlow, is very engaged, with a short attention span, constantly doing things, and very bright. Jesse, on the other hand, is lovely but only a bit over one year old. He's very different. I remember when Marlow was his age, he'd bring books for us to read, whereas Jesse shows no interest in that. It's fascinating to see such different characters.

I have three brothers, and there were similarities among us. It's early days, obviously, but it's interesting how, despite coming from the same genes and environment, they have incredibly different personalities at this stage. It's intriguing. I feel like I need to become a child psychologist to watch them. It's interesting to observe and think about development, especially since I enjoy reading about how brains work and develop. Some of that is fascinating.

I mentioned in an email that I hadn't responded to something written a long time ago, and I thought what Glenn was saying was really interesting. Every time I read a book, I find it relevant. The idea of how we create models of the world is absolutely fascinating. It was intriguing to see that in Marlow, observing how his development was changing. I noted how he used to refer to himself in the third person, but now he clearly says "I want, I want, I want." It's interesting from that perspective.

By the way, those books you mentioned in your last email, I've already downloaded them and added them to my database, which is quite large. The one you'd be really interested in is about the thousand brains, as it includes chapters on AI and AGI. The author is a Silicon Valley techie, which makes it interesting to see brain development from that perspective. His viewpoint is fascinating and aligns with what I observe in AI development. The current advancements are impressive in speed but not in creativity and adaptability. He was saying the same thing, which is why I found the book compelling. He suggests that AGI, developed based on how the brain actually works, would be dramatic and could be just a year or two away at the current rate.

The current developments in artificial intelligence are impressive in terms of speed but not in creativity and adaptability. The idea is that artificial general intelligence (AGI), developed based on how the brain actually works, would be revolutionary. This advancement is expected to occur in the next one or two years.

I haven't read all the related books, but I did find and analyze them, incorporating their ideas into my understanding. There's a chapter or two in "The Thousand Brains" that I think you would find fascinating. If you prefer, you can get the audible version.

The key difference between current AI and the proposed model is that current AI development is based on a flawed understanding of how brains work. The current models are seen as a dead end because they don't accurately reflect brain function. The suggestion is that AI developers don't fully understand the brain's workings. His research indicates that brains operate on individual models that predict changes and interact with each other. Instead of a central CPU, you need numerous small CPUs that interact.

Evolution has shaped our brains over millions of years, but by reverse engineering, we could create a different model for AI and AGI. This approach is based on a different understanding of brain function. The concept of the brain changes from a single entity to a collection of many small, interacting parts. This idea is reminiscent of the "Numskulls," characters from a comic where a boy's head is compartmentalized, with little people managing different aspects of his life. It's similar to the idea of many small entities running the brain rather than a single brain.

It's like munchkins, or rather, numskulls. Numskulls were characters in a comic from my childhood. The comic depicted a boy's head compartmentalized with little people running all aspects of his life. You can find some of them on YouTube or the internet. It's a bit like that—lots of little things running your brain rather than a single brain. They were very funny comics, and that's the premise.

This concept seems reasonably accurate because the person I'm referring to is a successful entrepreneur and IT developer. He shares anecdotes from his time working with other technologists and his past experiences, offering a different perspective that has often proven correct. His insights, if true, suggest that approaching things from a slightly different angle has given him a good track record.

I found the book very readable. I listened to it, then listened again, and eventually bought it. It's one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time because it presents a different way of thinking that resonates with me. It aligns with my interest in models and creation, which is what I do. Having someone affirm that your brain works in a certain way is wonderful and affirming.

When I think about AI, creativity, and activities like drawing or modeling, I struggle to see the impact AI, even AGI, could have on these personal pursuits. If AI provided more options to engage in these activities by being a wealth creator, that would be great. However, the downside is the potential for wealth to be concentrated among a few individuals, rather than distributed more equitably—a political issue rather than a technological one.

Regarding the book, it suggests that there should be many CPUs rather than one central unit, which is an interesting perspective.

If you think about it, having many CPUs rather than one central unit would be great. It aligns with a more socialist perspective, where wealth and power aren't concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. However, this is more of a political issue and not directly related to technology.

Regarding AI, I was surprised to learn that it should be multi-centered, like a network modeled on the brain and mind, rather than a single entity with all the control. I thought AI was already designed this way. I'll read more about it, as I'm not an expert like Gary. Maybe it's still based on that idea, as Heidegger and Dreyfus suggested in the 80s. They argued against the Cartesian model of a single entity controlling everything, advocating instead for a distributed approach where we interact with the world as part of a meaningful whole.

AI, as I understand it, should be able to simulate this distributed nature through its learning structure. Although I might not fully grasp it, I believe AI models the world in various ways. These models can be three-dimensional, linguistic, musical, or related to taste or smell. They have different types of memories and can create diverse models, not limited to one type. This complexity is challenging to comprehend because when I think of a model, I typically envision a 3D model.

They have lots of memories and different types, all structurally the same, but with the ability to create different things. It's not as if they're limited to one type of model. They are capable of creating various types of models. Initially, it was challenging to think about this because when I think of a model, I think of a 3D model, which is straightforward. However, when it came to other models, like a model of language or music, it required more thought and became quite interesting. These are still models, but not what one would typically consider a model.

It's fascinating how these models relate to each other, with some bonds being stronger than others. This changes throughout our lifetime. For instance, the potential bonds between language models are much greater when you're young, making it easier to learn languages. Young children in bilingual homes learn languages more easily and can continue to learn languages later because of more connections between these language modules. This concept differs from how AI is currently being developed.

Additionally, these models have a predictive element, involving complex chemistry and physics. They aren't just static models; they predict the next thing, which is useful because we need a model that anticipates future events. This predictive capability is part of what we consider thinking or consciousness, as these models light up and interact with each other.

This approach is different from AI development, which I don't fully understand, but I trust the explanation. AI has seen significant developments recently, with different levels emerging. The most basic level we're familiar with is the large language model, essentially a vast confabulation machine, similar to how humans use language.

The development of AI has seen significant advancements, even in the past few months. The most basic level we're familiar with is the large language model, which functions as a confabulation machine, similar to how humans use language. We often anticipate what we'll say next without much thought because the connections are already established. This process is known as confabulation.

I recall Elfie mentioning something about extroverts needing to speak out their thoughts to develop ideas. This use of language helps explore unfamiliar concepts. Personally, I find this challenging, but it's a way to navigate the neural net. Once you start articulating, you can enter an automatic mode of confabulation, much like large language models do. However, these models can't create something entirely new; they rely on existing information.

Previously, large language models were limited to pure confabulation. Now, there are models called mixtures of experts, which involve multiple smaller CPUs. OpenAI and others use these models, which operate on different levels in various technical areas. The real difference between current AI and future developments isn't creativity, as AI is on the verge of achieving that, but curiosity. AI cannot yet be curious like humans.

Currently, we have large language models, mixtures of experts, and powerful reasoning models. There are a few more levels to reach before achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). The question remains: what happens when we reach that point?

Being creative is linked to curiosity. AIs cannot be curious in the same way humans can be, at least not at the moment. Currently, we have large language models (LLMs), mixtures of experts, and reasoning models, which are extremely powerful. There are a few more levels to go before we reach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The question then becomes, what happens when we achieve AGI?

We have this concept of emergence, where greater complexity leads to new properties or behaviors. Out of this complexity, will curiosity emerge? Once we have curious AIs, it could be a game-changer for humans, as they could become genuinely creative. They would want to know things and explore what they can do. I think we're currently at level two or three of this hierarchy.

Some people are already talking about AGI being here in its infancy. I'm not completely convinced, but I do believe it's imminent and could be closer than many think, possibly within a couple of years. This is due to the rapid expansion of data centers being built by companies like Microsoft, which are even considering building nuclear power stations to power their systems. This serious hardware development is going to change everything.

However, even if a super-intelligent AI takes over and makes humans obsolete, it cannot replicate the human experience. AI is modeled on humans as thinking beings, translating everything into thoughts, even feelings. While AI can know everything about the sea, create images of beaches, and write poems about them, it cannot walk into the sea and experience the sensation. It can think and analyze, but it cannot embody the human experience. Humans care about their bodies and the sensations they feel, which AI cannot replicate.

The sea can inspire images of various beaches, and AI can create poems about them. However, AI cannot physically experience walking into the sea and the sensations that come with it. It can describe the molecular structure and think about it, but it cannot embody the experience. Humans care deeply about physical sensations, which is a significant part of being human. AI and human experiences run parallel because AI is primarily a cognitive experience, leaving out much of what it means to be human.

Even with advanced technology, like a super chair that simulates sensations, these attempts are not very successful. Devices like headsets offer a reduced experience of what it means to be a body on this planet. The focus has often been on cognition, neglecting the profound impact of our biochemistry and embodied existence on our thoughts and feelings. We are a biochemical entity, not silicon.

Some argue that AI might compete with humans in the future, but currently, it cannot model human experience. AI is a large language model, and language represents only a small part of human existence. It hasn't yet bridged the gap to embody a physical presence or a way of being in the world.

AI might run parallel to humans, almost like another species, potentially more intelligent or capable in various ways. However, AI will not take over unless programmed to do so, as it lacks evolutionary needs. It doesn't need to change the environment as humans have. In the future, AI might coexist alongside humans as a separate entity.

Have you heard of transhumanism? It's a significant concept that explores the integration of technology with human life.

According to the book, AI will not take over unless it is programmed to do so. It would require specific reasons to act in such a way. Since AI is not evolved, it doesn't need to change the environment as humans have, which has affected other species. It seems possible that another species could run parallel to humans in the future. Have you heard of transhumanism? It's a significant concept, and I believe there's a chapter about it in the book. This relates to brain-machine interfaces, like Neuralink. Have you heard of that? The book discusses it, though I can't recall the details. The author seemed a bit dismissive, but I'd need to revisit it.

It's easy to dismiss these ideas, but many people, including Elon Musk with Neuralink, are working on them. If people think about these concepts, they often strive to make them a reality. Science fiction often tries to predict the future, and if people can imagine it, they may attempt to create it. This has happened with many technologies. Transhumanism is a peculiar concept but has a strong following in Silicon Valley. It aligns with the longevity movement and other similar ideas. A strange world might emerge where a class of people is constantly connected to AIs, enhancing their cognition. The question then becomes, what will they do with that cognition?

In the short term, there may be more benefits. Unless there are technological solutions to global warming and climate change, humanity is in trouble. Humans won't survive in the way we currently understand survival. Political solutions seem unlikely, so technological ones are the only alternative. We lack the ability to create these solutions, so AI might be the only hope. If AI doesn't provide solutions, we're in trouble anyway. My view is that the only solutions to issues like climate change and poverty are political, but there are technological solutions as well.

At the moment, there doesn't seem to be a political solution to the challenges we face, such as climate change and poverty. These are inherently political issues, and while there are solutions, they are often politically unpalatable and unlikely to be implemented due to the lack of political will. Technological solutions exist, but they require political support to be put into action. We already know what needs to be done to address these problems, but the barriers are political, not technological.

The issue often boils down to power dynamics and the desire to maintain control over territories or populations. The question arises whether AI could eventually overcome these obstacles. Technological advancements, like nuclear fusion, have been in development for a long time but progress slowly. If advanced AI could accelerate these developments, we could potentially have access to power sources that don't rely on fossil fuels, offering cheap and safe nuclear power. This would be advantageous for both political and commercial interests.

Currently, such advancements seem distant, and the only way they might occur is through AI. Our current political systems are unlikely to change in time to address these issues effectively. If we had alternative energy sources that were cheaper, more efficient, and safe, we would naturally shift away from fossil fuels. However, without significant technological breakthroughs facilitated by AI, this shift remains unlikely.

We are not going to save the planet with our current politics, and there doesn't seem to be any evidence that they will change. In fact, they seem to be getting worse. While people do change, it takes a long time, and we don't have that time. If we didn't need to use fossil fuels, we wouldn't. If there were cheaper, more efficient, and safe alternatives that didn't produce CO2, we would use them because it would be to our advantage. However, these alternatives don't exist at the moment, and we humans don't have the ability to create them. But AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) could, and as far as I can see, that's our only savior. If AGI eventually gets rid of us, at least we'll be around to see it.

I agree with Rupert that there might be a new chance with AGI, and it doesn't seem like a political solution is possible. If you look at different political models like autocracy, democracy, or anarchy, none of them provide the right answers about climate change. Even powerful leaders like Xi Jinping or Trump don't have the solutions, nor do Western democracies. That's why I doubt a political solution is possible. The warring nations in Sudan don't have it either. None of our political models seem to have any idea of how to address these issues.

This aligns with my latest pursuit, which is radical Advaita. It suggests that nothing can be done, and one must just observe and wonder. I don't see how there's any influencing going on as an individual, other than what naturally comes through you. If you find yourself marching down the street in London protesting against climate change, that's great. But it cannot be a call to everyone because there is no singular entity to bring it about. The human experience is like distributed processing with only a commentator, not someone who can enact change, although things might appear to get done.

I agree that in the past, movements like Martin Luther King's, Gandhi's, and the suffragettes have made change through nonviolent protests. These movements have shown that change is possible, even if it seems elusive now.

Although things might get done, I agree that nonviolent movements have historically been seen as effective. When I was involved in radical climate change protests, there was a philosophy that we needed a movement similar to those of the past, like Martin Luther King's or Gandhi's nonviolent protests, or even the suffragettes, despite their occasional violence. These movements did lead to change, as seen with the suffragettes, who helped secure votes for women. The argument was that nonviolent protests would work, but it hasn't been effective on a global scale. The examples given were successful locally, not universally.

Politically, I don't think nonviolent protests will work. I've always believed that nothing changes without violence or the threat of it. I don't like this view, but it seems to be the reality. Nonviolent movements, like Gandhi's, are often cited, but 20 million Indians died during the separation of Pakistan, which was incredibly violent. That wasn't Gandhi's protest, but an outcome of the separation, which he didn't predict. Martin Luther King might be a better example, as he started with the idea of opposing racial segregation nonviolently, which did change laws in the United States.

The suffragette movement, although attitudes were changing anyway, contributed to the idea of universal suffrage. In Britain, democracy was limited to a few, but now there is universal suffrage, even if not fully utilized. The change from aristocratic rule to broader parliamentary representation involved a lot of protest, but not much violence. There was no revolution needed for this change. While the French had a violent revolution, it's not always necessary for change to occur.

The transition from one political system to another often involves significant protest, but not all protests are violent. For example, the shift from a parliament dominated by a few aristocrats to one where anyone can be elected did not require a revolution. While the French had a violent revolution, it's not always necessary for change. Historical records of political revolutions, such as the Bolshevik Revolution or the Indonesian Revolutionary War, show that the outcomes are not always positive. Even the American Revolution, which led to a more peaceful society, is an exception rather than the rule. Violent revolutions often result in more oppressive societies. The Indonesian Revolution, for instance, led to decades of dictatorship, and the Bolshevik Revolution's effects are still felt today in a highly dictatorial society. Russia, for example, has reverted to a form of imperialism under what some call "Tsar Putin I."

The nature of societal change is complex and not linear. Despite the chaos, some argue, like Stephen Pinker in his book "The Better Angels of Our Nature," that we are becoming more peaceful. Statistically, there are fewer conflicts, fewer deaths in conflicts, less torture, and almost no legalized slavery compared to the past. Over the millennia, it seems we are treating each other better. However, the interpretation of these statistics can be challenging, as it depends on what is included or excluded. Pinker has delved into these statistics to support his claims.

Looking at the last ten years, and even over the millennia, I think we are generally nicer to each other. Statistically, there are fewer violent deaths, although it's a difficult statistic to measure. What do you include or exclude? If you only consider the major incidents, you might miss a lot. I would need to delve into those statistics to trust them fully.

One author got tired of hearing how bad the world was at dinner parties, so he decided to investigate and wrote a book. In it, he argues that statistically, things aren't as bad as they used to be, even though there are fluctuations. The general trend seems to be that we are less unpleasant to each other.

I'm also reading a book about Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Cromwell, which covers a fascinating period in British history. It was a significant political change that began with religion. Back then, torture was an accepted method for the state to uncover the truth, and there was no protest against it. In Britain today, no mainstream political party would consider such actions reasonable.

Over the last 500 years, things have changed. Slavery is a clear example. Not long ago, it was considered reasonable and lawful for some people to own others. Now, I'm confident that no country legally endorses slavery in their constitution. This seems to be an improvement, or perhaps a transformation. Instead of explicit slavery, we now have concepts like wage slavery or mortgage slavery. However, these are not the same as the ownership of one person by another.

The consequences of not being a wage slave can be significant, but using the term "slavery" in this context is different. The legal ownership of one person by another is not something that exists anywhere today. It's a transformation in the use of the word, but not the same concept.

The concept of "mortgage slavery" or "wage slavery" is often debated, but these terms do not equate to the historical and legal definition of slavery, which involves the ownership of one person by another. While the consequences of being a "wage slave" can be severe, it is not the same as legalized slavery. The term "slavery" in this context is used metaphorically to describe economic dependency or exploitation, but it does not involve legal ownership.

The argument about whether one has a choice in being a "wage slave" is complex. It raises questions about economic systems and personal agency. Historically, the term "slavery" has been seen as ethically unacceptable, and while it has been replaced by other forms of exploitation, such as economic dependency, these do not involve legal ownership.

During the gold rush in America, miners were often indebted to equipment suppliers, creating a situation where they were bound by debt. This was not legally slavery, but it did create a form of economic bondage. These are matters of definition rather than actuality.

As a society, we have changed definitions and practices over time. Whether this is a reason for pride is debatable. Some see it as a historical movement towards improvement, while others are not convinced that the majority of people are better off. The notion that fewer people die in conflicts now compared to the past is also debated. Historically, more people may have died in violent conflicts as a percentage of the population, but predicting future conflicts remains uncertain.

In discussing historical conflicts, such as the Seven Years' War or the Thirty Years' War, it's important to consider the context and scale of these events. The impact of such conflicts on populations and the progression of society is complex and multifaceted.

The word "slave" and the concept of people dying due to violent conflict have evolved over time. Historically, a higher percentage of the population died in violent conflicts than today. Is this progress beneficial? In the past, more people died in violent conflicts as a percentage of the population than they do now. But who do we include in these statistics? Consider the Seven Years' War or the Thirty Years' War in Europe. If we only count the armies, the numbers are relatively small, counted in thousands rather than tens of thousands. However, if we include the displaced populations and those murdered simply for being in the way, the numbers increase significantly. 

If we include these broader impacts in historical conflicts, why don't we also consider modern issues like climate change, which indirectly result from industrial actions and can lead to disasters like flooding in Bangladesh? Are these not also forms of conflict? If so, perhaps the number of people dying hasn't decreased as much as we think. The definition of violent conflict traditionally involves direct violence, but what about the indirect consequences of our actions, such as environmental damage?

Some argue that we are morally superior now, as suggested by thinkers like Steven Pinker, who claim we are progressing. However, I question whether we have truly made efforts to improve. The premise seems more aligned with Rousseau's idea that humans are generally pleasant to each other, and that civilization has introduced conflicts. We tend to be kind to those we know, and they, in turn, are kind to others. Generally speaking, we are social creatures who get along well with each other.

The conflicts we face today are largely a result of how societies have been constructed over the last 10,000 years. While we may be inherently kind, the structures and systems we've built can lead to conflict.

Conflicts are a broader issue, but generally, we are nice to each other. We tend to be kind to the people we know, and they, in turn, are nice to others. Overall, we get along well, like little puppies. The problem arises from the way societies have been structured over the last 10,000 years, particularly in recorded history. The hierarchical nature of these structures has created conflicts. It's not that we are inherently bad; it's the way we live that has caused these issues.

The premise of thinkers like Pinker is that systems like democracy, as opposed to monarchies, distribute power among more people, thereby deconstructing hierarchies. This allows us to exist more naturally, without these structures. If not for climate change and the threat of nuclear annihilation, we might continue progressing towards a state similar to before hierarchical institutions created problems. Unfortunately, climate change poses a significant threat.

Pinker presents this idea statistically, though I can't recall the specific book. There's also the notion from William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" that if young boys are left on an island, they will form groups and fight. However, there's no evidence supporting this idea. It has influenced many people's beliefs that we are naturally in conflict, reverting to a primitive state when left to our own devices. Psychologically, there's no evidence for this. We do other things, but that's not our nature.

In reality, if we look beyond media portrayals and focus on our personal experiences, there's no evidence that we are generally unpleasant to each other. We quite like each other. Anyway, I'm an optimist.

There is no psychological evidence to suggest that humans are inherently unpleasant to each other. In fact, when we look at life beyond media portrayals, we find that people generally like each other. I consider myself an optimist, and this reminds me of the time during the fall of Suharto in 1998 when I was living in Yogyakarta. The entire government system collapsed, with no bureaucracy, police, or army presence. Despite expectations of chaos, it was extremely safe, and I never felt unsafe during that period, which lasted at least two years.

Some might call this anarchy and predict violence, but that didn't happen. This could be attributed to the nature of Indonesian societies, but the absence of coercive authority doesn't necessarily lead to chaos. The idea that we need strict order, as suggested by "Lord of the Flies," isn't always true. There are many instances where government collapses, and people continue with their lives without resorting to violence.

In Britain, for example, there is rarely a strong police presence on the streets, and violent crime is rare. This suggests that unless circumstances are extreme, people generally don't act unpleasantly towards each other. It's more beneficial to cooperate, as we rely on each other for survival. If I harm you, it makes my life harder, so generally, we avoid such actions.

We are often told that the police aren't very effective at solving crimes. However, violent crime is rare in Britain and, I suspect, in many other countries. It's not something we generally do to each other unless circumstances are extreme. Generally speaking, we don't act unpleasantly towards one another because it's more beneficial to cooperate. If I need you to survive because you make or sell food, and I can buy it, then harming you would only make my life harder. 

As humans, we are generally community-minded and tend to like each other. It's the constructs of politics and religion that complicate things. A few power-hungry individuals often rise to the top, and they don't necessarily represent the general tendency to like each other. Those who rise to power often thrive on conflict or don't mind it. This is the "1% problem." Psychopaths may have had evolutionary benefits in the past, but have they outlived their usefulness? Should we consider isolating them?

While most people are just trying to get along, as seen in places like Indonesia, where there is minimal police presence and people generally follow the rules and treat each other well, there is still this phenomenon of being entranced by those in power. We can be seduced into not being so nice to everyone. When people seek answers to great problems, they often turn to religion or political figures who provide ready-made answers, discouraging further questioning. Political psychopaths excel at offering simple solutions, encouraging people to stop thinking critically. 

This tendency to seek easy answers is what psychopaths exploit. A significant portion of the population prefers not to think deeply and instead wants answers handed to them. This is the segment that often supports and votes for such leaders. It's a curious phenomenon.

Just repeat after me, and everything will be okay. You don't need to think anymore. Thinking is bad. The more you think, the worse things get. They might have a point to some extent, but that's what it comes down to. There's a significant number of people who don't want to think and just want answers given to them. This is what the psychopaths prey on—this 30% of the population that doesn't want to think and votes in psychopaths.

I've been thinking lately that we are vulnerable to these influences as populations. There's a lot of mental health problems at the moment because we have become very thinking-oriented. Rather than people not wanting to think, perhaps people think too much. If we were more in our zone, in a kind of flow state—manipulating materials, making things, whether it's gardening or forging—we would not think as much. We would just handle things and work with our equipment. The beauty of that state is often not thinking. People generally describe it as the most blissful state, almost not thinking, but just being in the doing. It's a special kind of doing, just handling things, and it's proven to be good for mental health.

It's not that we don't want to think, but we don't want troublesome thinking. Troublesome thinking often involves problems and things not going well. Then, we might be open to people telling us that everything will be alright. But we don't want to think that way. We want to think of something better, something promising, something that promises us a golden future where we don't need to worry.

If we were encouraged to go back to making things, there would be more manufacturing. Personal experiences like shaping trees or repairing a socket give so much pleasure. It's all physical, manipulating physical things and using your body. I think that's very interesting and aligns with things I've been thinking about, presumably because of what I've been reading. It's this idea of the whole body experience. I've always feared written language and am naturally more inclined to physicality, doing, and making things. It seems to me that we do less of that now. There's a much greater emphasis on language in schools, where literacy is preeminent.

Using your body as a tool is a concept I've been contemplating, likely influenced by my recent readings. It's the idea of a whole-body experience. I've always had a fear of written language and naturally gravitate towards physicality, doing, and making things. It seems that we engage in these activities less frequently now. In schools, for example, there's a strong emphasis on language and literacy, which is considered paramount. This focus is a construct of our recent evolution or societal structuring, but it can be disadvantageous to mental well-being. Language is an addition, not part of our essential nature, whereas being in the world involves manipulating things.

Interestingly, I've noticed locally that there are more small institutions focused on making. In Hastings, there are now two successful commercial potteries that focus on individual creativity. One, called Mudworks, used to be a clothing store. People flock there for courses on ceramics and pottery, and they're completely oversubscribed. There's another similar institution in Hastings. It's amazing that people are eager to spend money on playing with clay. The work I do with wood is similar; I've volunteered to teach, and the courses are sold out. People are interested in manipulating materials, something they may not have had access to before but are now eager to explore.

It's interesting that this isn't something offered by the National Health Service, yet people naturally gravitate towards craft-oriented activities. The idea of manipulating materials is significant. I've noticed that many of my patients are becoming "super seekers," feeling the need to think themselves better. This trend highlights the importance of engaging with the physical world as a means of well-being.

It's interesting that people naturally gravitate towards craft-oriented activities. The idea of manipulating materials is something I've been working on lately. I've noticed that many of my patients are becoming "super seekers," feeling the need to improve themselves. However, they often become distraught because they focus too much on their ego, which needs to be purified in a Dharma sense.

The mindfulness movement seems to have taken a wrong turn, becoming another method for people to enhance their mind constructs rather than eliminating their egoic being. People are desperately seeking ways to heal and cure themselves, believing this will lead to a good life. This seeking becomes more manic, as I've observed in those I work with in the mindfulness business.

This makes me reflect on our course. When Gary got in touch, I was intrigued. There's a fundamental rift for me. On one hand, we were taught to see the self as less prominent and explore non-self, which I find appealing. On the other hand, we were encouraged to be more ethical beings. This raises the question: if there is nothing, what exactly are we improving? I don't think this question is ever truly answered.

I looked into Stephen's recent work, and he's still focused on ethics. But who is supposed to do these good things if there is no one? Who can instigate anything anyway? Individual well-being seems to lie in being embodied, doing things with your hands, and feeling things. When you're engaged in these activities, you become less of an individual. The less "you" there is, the better. The more we think of ourselves as individuals, the worse things become. If we see ourselves as part of a community rather than as individuals, it's a far healthier way to be in many respects. I agree with this perspective.

Absolutely right. To me, when you're doing those things, as you say, there is much less of you. The less you there is, the better. The more we think of ourselves as individuals, the worse things are. If we think of ourselves not as individuals but as a community, then there is a "we," not a "me." I think that's a far healthier way to be in all sorts of respects.

I never got on with Stephen's idea of non-self and not-self. I always think, why hang on to the self bit? I've never thought of it that way from an ethical perspective. You always think ethics is good, so you should try to be more ethical. But actually, that means there has to be a "you" doing it. We humans are probably quite ethical anyway, without interference. If you take away the structures, as Gary says, we get on okay. We don't need another layer of ethics to tell us how to act. That would be my argument. Nothing would change. In my experience, nothing changes. My actions remain similar; kindness happens, unkindness happens. There's no difference.

I can't see any in my patients, although they give themselves a hard time because their individual isn't coming up to scratch. That leads to a lot of unhappiness due to harsh judgments. You're doing me good, you two. Well, it's been lovely. I hate to be the killjoy, but it's been two hours. Are you sure? Yes, it is. Well, it says on my... And I'm doing my good deed. I have to go and plug my daughter's oven in. She just got an oven and needs someone to wire it in for her. She doesn't want to pay an electrician, of course. She's got a dad. I promised I'd do it.

I've been thinking we shouldn't leave it until Gary comes up with a WhatsApp. We left it a year, and we shouldn't. It's very beneficial for me to meet you more than once a year. Maybe we should make it at least twice a year and say we'll meet in no more than six months' time. All it takes is a message. You're the message man, Gary, so I'm relying on you to send a message. Okay, okay. But you send a message. It's February, so it has to be before the 8th of August. Is that right? Yes. Okay. It has to be before the end of August. Hopefully before then, because I may have some things developing. Well, that's your maximum you're allowed. That would be amazing. Okay, okay. We'll see you all then. Yes, well, lovely to see you again. Can't wait. Okay, then. We'll see you all again.
