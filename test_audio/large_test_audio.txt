Hello, Elfie. Are you there? I can't hear you. How about this? That's better. Better? And Rupert's here too. Oh my goodness, very punctual. Absolutely. Look at you; I have to stare at you a bit. Still alive, huh? Yes, yes. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Oh good, good. 

So, what has been happening? How long has it been since we last spoke? Let's see. It might be over a year, a bit over a year. It was around this time last year, wasn't it? Yeah, about that. I can't quite recall. I'll figure it out. We could find the last Zoom meeting to check. We should be able to work it out by the length of your beard, Carolyn. 

Well, it stays very much the same. My hair actually stops growing. I never have to trim anything; I just let it go. There's actually a group, the Sikhs, who never cut their hair as part of their dharma. So I've sort of adopted that. I never cut it or do anything; I just let it do its thing, you know? Letting my free flag fly. 

I like that. Let it do its thing. Yes, that's a fitting dharma concept. Yeah, I think so. Well, I've been letting my hair grow for a long time, but it seems to have no effect at all. 

Well, you know, keep hoping. That's one of the first things that impressed me when I started exploring Heidegger's thinking. He gives this example of a man going bald. He has no control over this whatsoever, of course. But what he does have control over is how he interprets that situation. He might go and create a persona like Yul Brynner or adopt a North Korean style where everyone else in the country shaves their hair so that he doesn't stand out. 

I think that's an example of megalomania. We have plenty of examples of that in the world right now. Yes, at the moment. There are a few things going on—strange external factors starting to develop. I've actually been rather distressed by what I've been hearing and seeing about what's happening in the UK. 

I don't know if it's just my particular news feeds affecting my perspective, but it seems pretty dire. It doesn't seem very healthy at all. Is that just me being overly negative, or are things really that bad? 

In what way are they bad, I suppose? I guess I'm focusing on homelessness and poverty—those sorts of issues. I tend to orient myself towards those topics. I seem to get a constant stream, especially in my YouTube feeds, about how dire things are in the UK, how people are just up and leaving. A lot of people are heading for Southeast Asia, basically giving up on the UK and saying, "I'm out of here."

Is my perspective overly negative, or are things really that bad? In what way are they bad? I guess I'm focusing on homelessness and poverty. Those are the issues I tend to orient myself towards. I seem to get a constant stream of information, especially in my YouTube feeds, about how dire things are in the UK. Many people are leaving, heading for Southeast Asia, essentially giving up on the UK and saying they can't afford to live here anymore. 

Is my perspective skewed by the YouTube algorithm, or is this really happening? It's not noticeably worse than it has been. In fact, it may be better in terms of homelessness because we have a government that seems to care a little more now. Regarding poverty, with a less right-wing government, it might improve slightly in the future. 

There is a lot of negative press, but that's always been the case, particularly from the right-wing media. I don't follow any specific YouTube channels on these topics, as the right-wing press typically doesn't focus on poverty or homelessness. My feeds consist mainly of the BBC and The Guardian, which don't present these issues prominently. 

However, the everyday evidence of walking around Hastings or London suggests that things are no better than they have been. One hopes that the government will address some of these issues, but we have certainly been left with a mess. There's no doubt that the situation is worse than it has been for a long time, and many institutions are in a poorer state. 

On the other hand, the NHS, which has been run down, still provides decent care. My son-in-law works for the NHS, and while it is difficult, it is not unmanageable. I spoke with someone last night whose partner had serious operations and was going in for more. The level of care and speed of service was remarkable, and they confirmed it was all through the NHS, not private care. 

This is anecdotal, but I suspect that if you're young, it might be challenging. I'm trying to think of my children and their peers, as well as the young people I know here. I don't see a significant crisis. What's your perspective, Alfie? 

Pretty much like you, I'm not aware of anything going terribly wrong right now. There isn't much improvement either, and one wonders how much can really be done in this situation.

This is all NHS. It's only anecdotal, but I suspect that if you're young, it might be difficult. I'm trying to think of my children and the people they know, as well as the young people I know here. I don't see that. I think it might be a different situation. What's your perspective, Alfie? 

Pretty much like you, I'm not aware of anything going terribly wrong now. There's not much improvement either, and one wonders how much can really be done in this situation. However, I don't pick up on any huge unrest in the population. In my news feeds, similar stories come up about Germany. I hear that Germany is in terrible trouble and that everything is going badly wrong, especially with the elections happening today. That seems to be hyped up. From what I know from my family there, everyone is just going on living, just like here.

How is it in Indonesia, or where are you at the moment, Gary? Are people just living? 

Well, I think Indonesia really isn't caught up in the same sort of dramas that Western countries are involved in. There are certainly demonstrations happening right now, with students back out on the streets, which is good to see. But in terms of everyday life, I don't think we've been as affected as many other countries. We have a different economy that isn't necessarily in lockstep with Western economies. I haven't noticed much, although there are a few danger signals on the horizon. 

Otherwise, there's very little crime here. While crime does exist, you don't fear for your safety at all in Indonesia, no matter where you are. You can feel safe. It's just that sort of culture. When I was in the UK, I only visited twice, but I certainly didn't feel completely safe. That could have been due to my unfamiliarity. Even in Australia, you find yourself looking over your shoulder, wondering what someone is up to. You just don't get that feeling in Southeast Asia generally, and certainly not in Indonesia. You can feel safe, whether that's justified or not is another question. I've never really felt unsafe here, unlike in some other countries. It might have just been my unfamiliarity with Europe and the UK that led to that feeling. I just didn't feel completely safe, and it could be due to completely unjustified reasons. It's hard to say.

What's this fellow up to? You just don't get that sort of thing happening in Southeast Asia generally, but certainly in Indonesia. You can feel safe here, whether that's justified is another question. I've never really felt unsafe, unlike in some other countries. It might have just been my unfamiliarity with Europe and the UK that led to that feeling. I just didn't feel completely safe, and it could be due to completely unjustified reasons. It's hard to say. I can't be completely objective because I haven't been there long enough to really know it well.

What I would say is that there is a kind of breathlessness about Europe that I feel. We're getting addicted to drama, always wondering where the next news will come from. You turn on the radio in the morning and wait for the next humdinger from Trump, Musk, or whoever it is. If it's not coming, it's almost like the day hasn't started. I've noticed this expectation in myself; our brain chemistry creates not just an expectation but a desire for something dramatic. Ordinary life becomes boring.

I see this reflected in the news, where everything seems to be going south and falling apart. The media here, including YouTube, has noticed that humans respond to that kind of storytelling drama. That gets you the views. You have to say something spectacular in the first 20 seconds to have a chance of making money from your channel. That's what it looks like to me. If Indonesia is escaping that, then good for you. 

There are still many problems here; it's not as if there's no poverty, but it's not nearly as bad as in some other countries. People are generally well-fed and not absolutely struggling. I've been living in Bali for the past year or more, so I've only made a few trips out of the country. I haven't really seen what's going on in Jakarta or other places in Indonesia.

Your point is that we see drama, and I certainly seek it out to an extent. Trying to follow developments in AI, for example, is nonstop. It's like a freight train, and there's no way to not keep up. It gets very much tied in with politics as well. AI is now extremely politicized in some ways. Have you heard about DeepSeek, the Chinese AI? Yes, that's caused huge consternation, but basically, it just cloned. Is that the cheap one? 

Well, if you mean it's free, I can download it onto my own machine and run it myself. You need a pretty good server, but it's open source.

You just have to keep up; there's no way to avoid it. AI has become extremely politicized in many ways. Have you heard about DeepSeek, the Chinese AI? Yes, it has caused huge consternation, but it essentially just cloned existing models. Is that the inexpensive one? Yes, it's free. You can download it onto your own machine and run it yourself, although you need a pretty good server. 

It's open source, so you can just grab it. However, you are somewhat limited. It's interesting that there's this egalitarian Chinese version, which is not what we would typically assume; it would be more controlled by the state. It is highly sensitive regarding Chinese content, but you can easily adjust that by downloading one of their models and modifying the system prompt. It's very simple to fix.

If you visit their DeepSeek site, which most people do if they don't have a machine that can run these models, you will get extremely biased results. The actual system itself has many different levels. I've only been able to run the 32 billion parameter model; the real model goes up to around 670 billion parameters, which I can't run because I don't have a machine capable of that. I only have one GPU, which is a type of hardware that accelerates the running of AI neural networks. 

I have one in my server in Jakarta, which cost about $25,000 just for that alone. I can barely run the 70 billion parameter models. If you look at the other models being run, especially the really large ones, I have no hope of competing. People like Elon Musk have hundreds of thousands of these GPUs, while I have just one. 

Despite this, you can still run these models. The political aspect is that they essentially cloned an OpenAI AI, one of their premium models called O1, which is a reasoning model. They cloned the entire system for about $6 million, compared to the billions that OpenAI spent to develop their O1 reasoning model. Now, there is a conflict, particularly from the US, which is banning anyone from using DeepSeek in any form and cutting them off from high-performing GPUs, banning sales of GPUs to China. However, they have managed to use their older GPUs and clone it anyway. I remember reading that this uses far fewer resources than the models produced by the Americans.

They say it was developed for about $6 million, compared to the billions that OpenAI spent on their O1 reasoning model. There is now a conflict, particularly from the US, which is effectively banning anyone from using DeepSeek in any form and cutting off access to high-performing GPUs, including banning sales of GPUs to China. However, they have managed to use their old GPUs and clone the technology anyway. 

This new model reportedly uses far fewer resources than those produced by American companies, which could lead to greater access for individuals and tech enthusiasts. While this seems like a positive development, there is a sense that the anticipated impact of AI has not materialized as expected. A year ago, there was hope for significant advancements, but in everyday life, the changes have not been as dramatic as predicted. 

In some industries, particularly in advertising, job losses are occurring as AI can easily generate text. However, the overall impact of AI on a global scale remains unclear. Many writers and creators are facing job displacement, but it raises the question of whether those roles were sustainable in the first place. If a job can be done better by a machine, it may not have been a great job to begin with. 

Creative jobs, in particular, seem less likely to be replaced. While AI has made strides, it still lacks true creativity. The technology is still in its early stages, and the combination of large language models and reasoning models is approaching a point where a creative process could be recognized. 

Next year, we can revisit this discussion. There may be many developments happening that people are not yet aware of, with AI increasingly assisting in tasks that have been taken for granted.

Language models, together with reasoning models, have reached a point where one could argue that a creative process is occurring. It's not going to be too much longer until we see significant developments. Well, this time next year, we can discuss it again. You mentioned that last year. Yes, I believe a lot of things will happen that people may not be aware of. Many aspects that have been taken for granted are now being greatly assisted by AI.

Absolutely, I can see that. AI can handle a lot of legwork and number crunching, which is what technology has always done. However, I struggle to envision the next level of replacing the unique contributions that humans make in fields like novel writing, composing, art, and sculpture. 

Where did she go? I don't know. Is she on your end? No, she's gone. Perhaps she got bored. But I observe so much happening week after week; it's a tsunami of developments in AI. The products that will emerge are still in development, and I think much has occurred beneath the surface that people aren't perceiving. 

Certainly, many have lost jobs; copywriting is an obvious example that has diminished significantly. Even in editing, I believe editors will increasingly use AI as an assistant to expedite their work. In fields like artwork, animation, and even live-action movies, things are progressing rapidly. We may soon see full-length feature films being developed, if not entirely AI-generated, then at least AI-assisted. 

CGI has been around for a long time, but it requires a lot of direction and can take an extensive amount of time to produce. In contrast, AI generation is incredibly fast and far surpasses CGI, which can take weeks or months to render. 

I can see the potential, but none of this is unexpected; technologies are advancing rapidly. I would be intrigued to see an AI-directed film that is indistinguishable from one directed by a human. I suppose when that happens, I will accept it. I can envision it in the context of a Marvel movie or something similar, but in terms of a film I would want to see, I remain skeptical. 

Where have you been? Have you gotten bored? Hello? We had a power cut. Yes, it's very windy here, and it just went out. Have you discussed all the important topics? Yes, what's been happening in Elfie World? Oh gosh, I had a challenging year. My beloved Johnny had cancer.

I suppose when that happens, then I'll accept it. But I just cannot see it. I can envision it in terms of something like a Marvel movie or Spider-Man, but not as a movie I would want to go and see.

Where have you been? Have you gotten bored? Hello. We had a power cut. It's very windy here, and it just conked out. Have you talked about important stuff now? 

Yeah, what's been happening in Elfie World? Oh gosh, I had a hell of a year, actually. My beloved Johnny had cancer, so last year was consumed with that. He had surgery, radiotherapy, and a lot of other treatments. At the moment, he's just coming out of our total involvement in that again, and it's looking okay.

Oh, great. That's good news. Yes, that was a new journey. 

Yes, that would occupy your mind a little bit. A lot. How is Lynn? 

Oh, she's fine. I think she's decided to adjust her medication as she thinks fit, not what the doctors say, because I don't think she needs very much at all. So, yeah, she's good. 

That's good news. And are all your beloveds all right, Gary? 

Okay, let's go through them. So many. Yes, actually, I guess a lot has happened in a year. It's been overwhelming in some cases, but in general, they're all doing fine. I need to do a round of visits to children in various parts. I have to go down to Melbourne where my daughter is studying at university. She is autistic and has been having issues adjusting to Australia. But, you know, she's been there nearly two years now, and I think she's gradually finding her feet, although she still feels a bit overwhelmed by the culture. 

She's studying at university, and that whole experience is completely new to her. Education in Indonesia is nothing like what it is in Australia; it's a completely different culture in terms of learning. 

Did I mention I have a new grandchild? My daughter in Jakarta, who was in Australia but moved back, is married to my senior accountant who is running the company now. She had a baby boy about five months ago, so that's grandchild number four.

How's your youngest son? 

He's as good as ever. I mean, he can do no wrong, of course. I think he's adjusting socially and doing okay. He's not doing badly, but he has very little interest in being around other kids. He likes being around them but doesn't really crave it or look for it. Anyway, that's just my perception. But otherwise, he's just fine. 

How old is he now? 

He's seven. 

All right. Well, he's as old as when we first met. Ananda was born slightly before I came to the course.

Child number four. How's your youngest son? He's as good as ever. I mean, he can do no wrong, of course. I think he's adjusting socially and doing okay. He's not doing badly, but he has very little interest in being around other kids. He likes it but doesn't really crave it or look for it. Anyway, that's just my perception. Otherwise, he's just fine. Yeah, he's doing fine.

How old is he now? He's seven. All right. Yeah, he's as old as when we first met. Ananda was born slightly before I came to the course. Those photographs were amazing. They were, yeah. I hope they jogged some memories. I didn't realize anyone was taking photographs. I'd seen some pictures of outside in the garden, but I hadn't seen any photographs of people. I was trying to remember all the people in the photos. I was a bit sneaky about how I did the photos because I can't remember anyone going around snapping. I couldn't even remember if we had mobile phones then.

Yes, we did have mobile phones, but with cameras. Yes, we did have mobile phones for sure. And Rupert, you got a new grandchild? I didn't know that. Yeah, I think he must have been born last time. We have them twice a week, and it's quite hard. When we had one, it wasn't too bad because there were two of us to share the responsibility. But with two, you can't really. All day long, you've got to be with one or the other of them. They're lovely, but it can be a bit boring, really. You know what I'm saying?

Yeah, children are like that. They can play chess. That would be all right; we could sit down and have a game. I'm trying to teach him noughts and crosses just to get started. I don't know, but he's not interested in that either. Jigsaws are okay because the elder one, who's three and a half, likes doing jigsaws. But his attention span is not great. It's odd because he used to get very involved in things, and that was quite nice. He could sit and look after himself, but now he moves quite quickly from one thing to another. He gets bored and has to do something else.

It's interesting because they're siblings but very different—remarkably different in their approach to life. The elder one, Marlow, is very engaged, has a short attention span, and is constantly doing things. He's very bright. Jesse is lovely, but he's only one and a bit. He's very different. I remember when Marlow was his age, he'd go and get books for us to read, whereas there's nothing like that with Jesse at all. It's a very different character. I think of myself; I've got three brothers, and there were similarities between all of us.

It's interesting because they're siblings, but very different—remarkably different in their approach to life. The elder one, Marlow, is very engaged, has a short attention span, and is constantly doing things. He is very bright. Jesse, on the other hand, is lovely but only one and a bit. He is very different. I remember when Marlow was his age; he would go and get books for us to read. There’s nothing like that with Jesse at all. It's a very different character.

I have three brothers, and there were similarities among us. It's early days, obviously, but it's intriguing how, despite coming from the same genes and being in exactly the same environment, they have incredibly different personalities at this stage. I find it fascinating to observe their development. I enjoy reading about how brains work and develop, and some of that information is captivating.

In an email I wrote, I mentioned that I hadn't responded to something written a long time ago. I found what Glenn was saying really interesting. Every time I read a book, I think, "That's interesting and relevant." The idea of how we create models of the world is absolutely fascinating to me. It’s intriguing to see this in Marlow and how his development is changing. I noticed that he used to think of himself in the third person, but now he clearly doesn’t. His thoughts are very much centered on "I want, I want, I want."

By the way, the books you mentioned in your last email have already been downloaded and incorporated into my database, which is very large. The one you would be particularly interested in is about the thousand brains, as it contains a lot about AI. There are a couple of chapters on AI and AGI. The author is obviously a Silicon Valley techie, which makes it interesting because it discusses brain development from that perspective. His viewpoint is fascinating and aligns with what I see in AI development.

What is happening at the moment is impressive in terms of speed, but not very impressive regarding creativity and adaptability. He shares the same sentiment, which is why I thought it was a good book—it reflects my own thoughts. He argues that AGI, or artificial general intelligence, developed based on how the brain actually works, would be very dramatic. That is coming.

AI development is currently impressive in terms of speed, but not particularly in creativity and adaptability. The discussion revolves around artificial general intelligence (AGI) and how it could be dramatically different if developed based on a better understanding of how the brain works. This advancement is likely one to two years away at the current rate.

While I haven't read the relevant books, I have located and downloaded them, incorporating insights into my understanding. There are chapters in "The Thousand Brains" that I believe you would find fascinating. 

The key difference between current AI and AGI lies in the understanding of brain function. Current AI development models how people think, but this approach may be a dead end. The argument is that developers do not fully grasp how brains operate. Research suggests that brains function through individual models that predict changes in the world, rather than relying on a central processing unit. 

Instead of a single CPU, many small, interacting units are needed. Our brains have evolved over millions of years, and by reverse engineering this complexity, a new model for AGI could emerge. The theory posits that the concept of the brain shifts from a singular entity to numerous smaller components working together. 

This idea is reminiscent of "Numskulls," characters from a comic I read as a child, where a boy's head is compartmentalized with various figures managing different aspects of his life. This analogy illustrates the concept of multiple interacting models within the brain.

Instead of thinking of a brain, envision lots of little components, similar to characters called Numskulls from a comic I read as a child. In this comic, a boy's head is compartmentalized, with various characters managing different aspects of his life. You can find a few of these comics online. The premise is that there are many little elements running your brain rather than just one central brain. They were very funny comics.

This concept seems reasonably accurate, especially considering the success of the author, who is an entrepreneur and IT developer. He shares anecdotes from his experiences with other technologists, providing a unique perspective that has proven to be insightful over time. His track record suggests that approaching problems from a different angle can yield positive results. 

I found the book very readable; I listened to it multiple times before deciding to buy it. It is one of the most fascinating reads I've encountered in a long time because it presents a different way of thinking that resonates with me. The author discusses models, which aligns with my own thought processes, as I enjoy creating things. Hearing someone articulate that our brains are filled with models was enlightening.

When I think about AI and creativity, particularly in activities like life drawing, I struggle to see how AI, even AGI, could impact these experiences or their relevance to what we enjoy. If AI could provide more options for creative expression, it could be beneficial. However, there are downsides, particularly from a political standpoint, where wealth tends to concentrate in the hands of a few individuals rather than being distributed more equitably. This concern is more about the political implications than the technology itself.

Regarding the book's argument, it suggests that there should be many CPUs rather than relying on one central processing unit.

You didn't have to go and do it; that would be great. It would be a nice thing. The downsides, obviously, are that from a political point of view, they could be doing the same things. What happens now is that a few individuals center all the wealth rather than it being from a more socialist perspective. But that's a political issue; it's not really related to the technology.

In regard to the book, it suggests that there should be many CPUs rather than one central unit. I'm a bit astonished because I thought that was how AI worked anyway—that it is multi-centered and not just one thing. It resembles a network and is modeled on the concept of the brain and mind rather than on a very constricted idea of one self that knows what's happening and needs to do one particular thing. I thought that was what AI was all about.

Because I'm not like Gary, I don't know how these things work, so I'll just read the book. But maybe it's not as straightforward as that. As a technology, perhaps it still follows that kind of idea. Heidegger and Dreyfus pointed out in the 80s that we are on the wrong path if we think in Cartesian terms, with one individual pulling all the levers. That will never work because we don't exist in the world like that. It is a distributed kind of existence where we are not just one thinking entity but are engaged in meaningful activities, like using hammers, for example.

I thought a big part of AI was that it actually understood this and, through its structure of learning, could simulate that kind of distributed existence. Therefore, it operates on those parameters. I know so little about it that I might be talking nonsense, but I think the key point is that these are not singular entities. The models consist of many little mechanisms that can create a model of the world, and just a model of the world. They can do this in various ways.

The models could be three-dimensional, linguistic, musical, or related to taste or smell. They have lots of memories and different types. While they are all structurally the same, they have the ability to create different things. It's not as if they are one thing that only does one type of model. They are capable of creating many different types of models. 

That was the challenging part to grasp. When I think of a model, I typically envision a three-dimensional model, which is straightforward. However, when it comes to other models, like a model of language or a model of music, that’s when I had to think more deeply, and it became quite interesting.

This type of model is 3D and capable of creating many different types of models. The challenge arises when considering models beyond the traditional 3D representation, such as a model of a language or a model of music. This requires deeper thought and becomes quite interesting. While they are still models, they differ from what one might typically envision.

The relationships among these models can vary in strength, which develops throughout our lifetime. For instance, the potential connections between language models in young children are much greater than in older individuals, making it easier for them to learn languages. Children in bilingual homes can acquire languages more effortlessly and maintain the ability to learn additional languages later on due to the increased connections between their language modules.

This perspective contrasts with current AI development. Additionally, these models incorporate a predictive element, which adds complexity. They are not static; instead, they anticipate what comes next, making them useful for understanding the world. We cannot rely solely on a static model; it must be dynamic and capable of predicting future events.

The discussion also touched on consciousness and thinking, suggesting that our cognitive processes involve various elements lighting up in response to one another. This interplay is perceived as our thought process. This approach to understanding consciousness differs from current AI methodologies, though I lack detailed knowledge of AI's internal workings.

Recent advancements in AI have occurred rapidly, with various levels of development emerging. The most basic level familiar to us is the large language model, which functions as a confabulation machine. This process mirrors human language use, where we anticipate our next words with minimal conscious effort because the connections are already established. This anticipation is a form of confabulation.

I think there are different levels of AI that have been developed even over the past couple of months, with huge advancements. The most basic level that we're usually familiar with is the large language model, which is essentially a massive confabulation machine. It closely resembles how humans use language; we confabulate and anticipate what we're going to say next without much conscious thought because the connections are already established. 

I'm reminded of what Elfie mentioned about being an extrovert and needing to articulate thoughts to bring out ideas. It’s like using language to explore something unfamiliar. I've often thought of that as something I struggle with, but confabulation serves as a way to explore the neural network. Once you start articulating something, you can enter auto mode and confabulate, which is exactly what large language models do. They confabulate in a manner similar to humans, but the significant difference is that they cannot create something out of nothing. The basic level of large language models is pure confabulation, and they cannot transcend that to generate something new.

Previously, we had older language models, but now we have models called mixture of experts, which consist of numerous small CPUs. Currently, some of OpenAI's models, including those by Mr. Jordan and others, utilize a mixture of experts model, but they typically operate at about eight or nine levels. These experts are embedded within the same large language model, allowing them to confabulate on different levels across various technical areas.

The real distinction between current AI and what is to come is not creativity, as I believe they are on the verge of being creative, if not already. It is curiosity. AIs cannot be curious in the same way that humans can, at least not at this moment. We have the large language models, the mixture of experts models, and extremely powerful reasoning models. There are likely a few more levels to explore before we reach artificial general intelligence (AGI). The question then becomes, what happens next? We have the concept of emergence, where new properties arise from greater complexity. Out of that complexity, will curiosity emerge?

At the moment, we have certainly developed large language models (LLMs), a mixture of expert LLMs, and reasoning models, which are extremely powerful. There are likely a few more levels above that, though I can't recall all of them. However, there are one or two levels to go before we actually reach artificial general intelligence (AGI). The question then becomes, what happens next? 

We have this concept of emergence, where new properties or behaviors arise from greater complexity. From that greater complexity, what will emerge? Will curiosity emerge? My thinking is that once we have curious AIs, it could be game over for humans, as they would then be able to be genuinely creative because they would want to know things and explore various possibilities. Currently, I believe we are probably at level two or three of that hierarchy.

Some people are already suggesting that AGI is here in its infancy. While I'm not completely convinced, I do believe it is imminent and could be closer than many think—perhaps within a couple of years—given the rapid expansion of data centers being built, not just by Musk but also by Microsoft. Microsoft is even considering building nuclear power stations to power their data centers. There is some serious hardware being developed that could change everything.

However, I wonder if these two ideas are distinct. This superintelligent AI might take over the world and render humans obsolete, but it still cannot replicate the human experience. I agree with Rupert that AI cannot compete with human experience. It seems to be modeled on humans as thinking beings, translating everything into thoughts, including feelings. 

For instance, AI can know everything about the sea and generate images of various beaches. It can even create poems about beaches. However, it cannot walk into the sea and experience the sensations associated with it. It cannot feel. While it can produce a poem and explain the molecular structure of water, it remains a thinking entity and cannot embody a physical presence. Perhaps the significance of the body will diminish over time, but humans care deeply about bodily sensations. In fact, we prioritize that more than anything else. Thus, the two—AI and human experience—do not merge; they run parallel to each other.

It can create poems about beaches, but it cannot walk into the sea and experience the sensations. It cannot feel. It can describe the molecular structure and everything related to it. It can be a thinking entity, but it cannot embody a physical presence. Perhaps this will become obsolete because fewer people care about it. However, humans do care about bodies and the sensations they experience. In fact, we prioritize that more than anything else. The two—AI and human experience—do not merge; they run parallel.

This whole AI phenomenon, even the most advanced versions, represents a thinking experience that leaves out 90% of what it means to be human. At this moment, I cannot envision how that would change. You could invent a super chair that simulates the sensation of being wet, but such inventions have not been very successful. We already have virtual reality headsets, yet they haven't gained widespread acceptance because they still offer a poor reduction of what it means to be a body on this planet.

The focus has always been on cognition, neglecting the significant influence that our biochemistry and embodied existence have on our thoughts and feelings. This biochemical makeup profoundly affects our brains; we are a biochemical soup, not silicon. 

That might explain why Rupert believes AI cannot compete with humans. However, perhaps it does compete, and in a hundred years, humans may not be regarded as important anymore because something else has taken over, which is fundamentally different. Currently, AI cannot model us in any meaningful way; it can only create language models. Language represents such a small part of our existence.

While it can be refined, as Rupert suggests, it has not demonstrated the ability to transition into a physical entity or a way of being in the world. I see AI as running parallel to humanity, almost like another species that may be vastly more intelligent or capable in various ways. According to one book, AI will not take over unless programmed to do so, as it lacks the evolutionary need to change its environment like we have, which has affected other species.

It seems there could be another species coexisting with humans in the future. Have you heard of transhumanism? That term is quite significant, and I believe there is a chapter in the book about it. Is this related to brain-machine interfaces?

You would have to program a machine to take over by giving it reasons for doing so. What would be the advantage? Unlike humans, it hasn't evolved and doesn't need to change the environment, which has affected other species. It seems likely that another species could run alongside humans in the future. 

Have you heard of transhumanism? It's quite a significant concept, and I believe there's a chapter in the book about it. Is this related to brain-machine interfaces? Yes, Neuralink comes to mind. Although it's been a while since I read the book, I recall that the author discusses it, but I thought he was somewhat dismissive. I would need to revisit that section to clarify.

It's easy to be dismissive, but many people are actively working on these ideas. Elon Musk's Neuralink is essentially a brain-machine interface. If people are thinking about these concepts, they will strive to make them a reality. Much of what we see in science fiction serves to predict the future. If people can envision it, they will want to create it. This has been the case with many technologies; the act of storytelling often inspires attempts to bring those stories to life.

Transhumanism is a peculiar phenomenon with a strong following in Silicon Valley, closely tied to the longevity movement and similar ideas. A strange world may emerge where a class of people is constantly plugged into AIs, possessing super cognition. This raises the question: what will they do with that cognition? 

I've been reflecting on this with Benice. If figures like Musk or Trump were a bit brighter, that would be beneficial. I'm working on building my Dharmic database to address the current issue of individuals lacking intelligence who hold significant power. 

The argument that one would program a machine to eliminate humans doesn't hold up. It wouldn't make sense to do away with humans entirely; the machine would integrate into our thinking patterns. While one might not want to program a machine to eliminate Americans, it could lead to harmful thoughts about other groups, such as the Chinese. These are old patterns of thinking, where one group considers themselves superior and views others as substandard, justifying their removal.

A machine to do away with humans wouldn't make any sense. You wouldn't want to eliminate humanity; it would just integrate into our thinking patterns. While you might not want to program a machine to eliminate Americans, it could easily lead to targeting other groups, like the Chinese, under the guise of making the world a better place. These are old patterns: the belief that "my people" are real people while others are substandard. I have no qualms about getting rid of those deemed unworthy. This is an outdated mindset, and I don't trust that argument. Why would anyone program a machine to eliminate humans? Not all of humanity, but certain individuals. Why not start with those particular ones that no one cares for, including certain religions, as has been done historically?

At the moment, I suspect that in the short term, there will be more benefits from AI. However, unless there are technological solutions to global warming and climate change, humanity is in trouble. Humans won't survive in any way we currently envision. I can't see political solutions emerging, so the only alternative is technological ones, and we currently lack the ability to create them. AI is the only potential solution, and if that doesn't happen, we are doomed.

My view is that the only solutions to issues like climate change and poverty are political, and there are indeed solutions. However, there are many reasons why they will never be implemented. Technological solutions require political will to be enacted. We already know there are solutions to climate change; the problem is that they are politically unsavory and won't get you elected. The solutions are political, not technological. We already have the technology and know what to do to fix these problems. The question is, why aren't these solutions being implemented? It comes down to power dynamics, with people wanting to retain control over territory or populations. 

Can AI, at some future point, overcome these impediments? No. What I'm referring to are technological developments like nuclear fusion, which have been in development for a long time and have progressed slowly. If advancements were made rapidly through artificial general intelligence (AGI), we could quickly have power sources that do not rely on fossil fuels.

People want to retain power over territory or a population in some way. The concept of "us and them" is central to this issue. Can AI, at some future point, overcome these impediments? No. What I'm referring to are technological developments like nuclear fusion, which have been in development for a long time and have progressed fairly slowly. If that progress were to accelerate through AGI, we could quickly have power sources that do not rely on fossil fuels. With cheap, safe nuclear power, there would be no need for fossil fuels. However, we currently lack the capability to achieve this with existing technology. AGI could potentially make this change happen.

If such advancements were available, politics would adopt them because they are cheap and safe. Commercial interests would also leverage these technologies for their advantage. At the moment, this scenario seems far off, but it is the kind of change that could occur. The only way I see this happening is through AI. Politically, as you mentioned, we are not going to save the planet with our current political systems, which do not appear to be changing for the better. In fact, they seem to be worsening. While people can change, it often takes a long time, and we do not have that luxury.

If we did not need fossil fuels, we would not use them. If there were cheaper, more efficient, and safe alternatives that do not produce CO2, we would adopt them. However, these alternatives do not exist at the moment, and we humans lack the ability to create them. AGI could potentially fill that gap, and as far as I can see, it may be our only savior. If AGI were to eliminate us afterward, at least we would be around to witness it.

I agree with Rupert that this might be our new chance, as it does not seem that a political solution is possible. Looking at various political models—autocracy, democracy, or anarchy—none of them provides the right answers regarding climate change. Those in power, like Xi Jinping or Trump, do not have effective solutions. Western democracies also fail to address the issue. None of our political models seem to have a viable approach. This aligns with my latest pursuit, which is radical Advaita, suggesting that perhaps nothing can be done.

None of them is capable. If you are someone who has full power, like Xi Jinping, he doesn't have it. Trump now wields significant power, but he doesn't either. The Western democracies don't have it. No one seems to have a solution, which is why I doubt that a political resolution is possible. The warring nations in Sudan don't have it either. Anarchy prevails, and none of our political models seem to offer a way forward.

This aligns with my latest pursuit, which is radical Advaita. It suggests that nothing can be done; it simply unfolds as it will. One must observe it in wonder and just be present. I don't see how individuals can influence anything beyond what flows through them. If you find yourself marching down the street in London protesting against climate change, that's great, but it cannot be a call to everyone because there is no collective "one." You cannot bring about change; there is no singular entity capable of doing so. The human experience is a distributed process, with only a commentator in the mind. While things might get done, it doesn't imply that anyone is in control.

I agree with the observation that when I was involved in more radical movements regarding climate change protests, there was a philosophy suggesting we needed a movement akin to those of the past, like Martin Luther King's or Gandhi's nonviolent protests, or even the suffragettes, despite their violent aspects. Those movements did effect change, as seen with the suffragettes who fought for women's voting rights. The argument was that nonviolent protests would work, but they haven't, and I don't believe they will on a global scale. The examples provided were effective locally but not universally applicable.

I maintain the view that nothing changes without violence or the threat of violence. I don't particularly like this perspective, but it seems to be the reality. Unless violence is involved, change is unlikely. The nonviolent movements often cited, such as Gandhi's, occurred during a time when 20 million Indians died amid the separation of Pakistan. That period was not nonviolent; it was incredibly violent. Gandhi did not foresee the consequences of the separation, and while I am not defending him, perhaps Martin Luther King is a better example of nonviolent resistance.

Unless there is violence involved, nothing will change. These nonviolent movements, often associated with Gandhi, are sometimes misrepresented. For instance, 20 million Indians died during the protests related to the separation of Pakistan, which was not a nonviolent event. That was an incredibly violent outcome of the separation, and Gandhi did not predict it. 

Martin Luther King Jr. may serve as a better example of nonviolent resistance. He began with the idea of opposing racial segregation through nonviolent means, which did lead to changes in laws in the United States. The suffragette movement also contributed to the shift towards universal suffrage, although societal attitudes were changing regardless. Not long ago in Britain, despite a semblance of democracy, only a few people were eligible to participate. Now, there is universal suffrage, although it is not fully utilized. The transition from a system where only a few aristocrats could be in parliament to one where anyone can be elected involved significant protest, but not much of that protest was violent. There was no revolution necessary for this change.

I disagree with the notion that change requires violence. The French Revolution was violent, but it is not a prerequisite for change. Historical records of political revolutions, such as those led by the Bolsheviks or during the Indonesian Revolutionary War, often show that the outcomes are not always positive. Even the American Revolution, which is sometimes viewed as producing a more peaceful society, led to more violent and oppressive societies in other contexts.

Violent revolutions can result in very negative outcomes. For example, the Indonesian Revolution ultimately resulted in 30 to 40 years of dictatorship. Similarly, the Bolshevik Revolution has left a legacy of dictatorial governance that continues to resonate today. Russia, for instance, has reverted to a form of imperialism under Putin, indicating that the revolution did not lead to significant change. The question remains: how much have people truly changed together?

For example, there were ultimately 30 or 40 years of dictatorship. The same goes for the Bolsheviks; that hasn't stopped yet. We're still seeing the reverberations of that revolution, and there is still a highly dictatorial society. With the Russians, they still have imperialism. It's almost all in the past. The revolution came and went, and they have now reverted back to Tsar Putin I. Well, they've never really reverted; they never really changed. 

How much have people changed together? It's incredibly chaotic. The outcome of it is not linear, despite the common perception that progress follows a straight line. Stephen Pinker’s ideas challenge that notion. In his book, "The Better Angels of Our Nature," he statistically argues that we are nicer to each other than we have been in the past. Percentage-wise, there are fewer conflicts now than there have been historically, fewer people die in conflicts, and there is less torture. There is now almost no legalized slavery, which has been prevalent for thousands of years of civilization.

If you look at it in those terms, I think we are nicer to each other over the millennia. However, I wonder if he needs to write an update over the last ten years. Statistically, there are fewer violent deaths, but that’s a difficult statistic to interpret. What do you include or exclude? If you only consider the major conflicts, you might overlook a lot of other issues. I would need to dig deeper into those statistics to have any trust in them.

Pinker became frustrated with people at dinner parties lamenting how bad the world was, so he decided to investigate. In his book, he presents evidence that things are not as bad as they seem, although they fluctuate. The general trend suggests that we are less unpleasant to each other over time.

Another book I'm currently reading is about Thomas Cromwell, which covers a significant period in British history marked by political change, largely driven by religion. During that time, what was acceptable by the state included torture as a means to uncover the truth. It was a reasonable and accepted practice, and there was no protest against it; it was simply what the state did.

Unpleasant to each other. Another book I'm reading at the moment is about Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Cromwell. It's a very interesting period in British history, marked by significant political change that begins with religion. In that context, one can observe what was acceptable by the state. Torture was seen as a reasonable method to uncover the truth; it was an accepted practice for the state, and there was no protest against it. This was simply what was done.

In Britain now, not even the most extreme parties would contemplate such actions as reasonable. Over the last 500 years, things have changed significantly. Slavery stands out as an obvious example. It wasn't long ago that enslaving other human beings was considered completely reasonable and was enshrined in law, allowing some people to own others. However, I am confident that there is no country in the world where such practices are legally recognized in their constitution today. This indicates an improvement, or perhaps a transformation rather than just an improvement.

It could be viewed as a shift. Instead of explicit slavery, we now have wage slavery and mortgage slavery. However, these are not the same as ownership of one person by another. While the consequences of being a wage slave can be severe, it is important to recognize that the term "slavery" in the context of one person owning another is not legally applicable anywhere today. 

That’s what I mean by transformation. I don't think it's the same thing; it's just a different use of the word "slavery." A wage slave does not equate to legalized slavery or ownership of one person by another. Do you have a choice about being a wage slave? Is there a choice? 

It's a different argument. It is still one person owning another in a sense. It’s a transformation, a different way of achieving the same outcome. I'm just presenting it as an argument. 

I'm not sure it's the same thing. What do you think, Alfie? There is historical change, but is there a distinction? Yes, that word has become ethically unacceptable. Has it been replaced by other means of subjugating humans or exploiting them, such as in mines in China? 

Was it considered slavery when white people mined for gold during the American gold rush? They were often deeply indebted to equipment suppliers and had no way out. That situation wasn't labeled as slavery, but one could argue it was equally binding, with no escape and a debt owed.

It has now been seen as ethically unacceptable. Has it been replaced with other ways of subduing humans or making them do what you want, exploiting them in some mine in China or elsewhere? Was it called slavery when mining occurred during the gold rush in America, where white people dug for gold but remained indebted to the equipment providers? That wasn't slavery, but it was a form of bondage. There was no way out; you owed them, and you couldn't just leave. These are matters of definition rather than actuality, perhaps. 

Can we be proud as humankind that we changed these definitions? I don't know. Morally and ethically, I question whether that is enough reason to be proud or rejoice. I see it as a historical movement, a change. To the better? I'm not sure. I'm not convinced. I'm not a Pinker person in the sense that I believe the majority of people are better off and that fewer people die in conflicts. That might be an incredibly short-term observation. Given the current state of the world, more conflict seems likely.

If we take away the word "slave," we still have people dying because of violent conflict. Historically, a higher percentage of the population died in violent conflict than do now. Is that beneficial progress? In the past, more people died in violent conflict as a percentage of the population than they do now. But who do you include? For example, consider the Seven Years' War or the Thirty Years' War on the continent. Who died in these wars? If you only count the armies, the numbers are relatively small, often in the thousands rather than tens of thousands. 

In Ukraine, for instance, more people may have died than during the Thirty Years' War if you only count the armies. However, if you include the entire population that was displaced or murdered simply for being in the way, the numbers increase significantly. This raises questions about how we define conflict. 

Moreover, if we include those who die due to climate change—often linked to warfare and the needs of industrial nations—then the narrative shifts. The need for energy and resources contributes to environmental degradation, leading to disasters like flooding in Bangladesh. Are those individuals part of the death toll? In that case, I would argue that there may not be fewer people dying; it could be a different form of violent conflict.

Go manifold. You could say that this is a matter of conflict. If you count those affected, why not also consider all the people who have already died due to climate change and those impacted by warfare, particularly in industrial nations that rely on AI and energy consumption? This leads to warming and flooding in places like Bangladesh. Are they part of that? In which case, I would argue that the number of people dying may not be decreasing. 

This is violent conflict, defined as people dying in violent situations. Is it less violent if I need energy and cause flooding in Bangladesh? This could be viewed as a different way of waging wars. I’m not suggesting that we are morally superior, as I hear Pinker claim that we are getting along better and making efforts. I question whether we have truly made those efforts. 

Pinker’s premise aligns more with Rousseau's idea that, in general, we are pleasant to each other. However, this is a relatively recent issue that coincides with the development of civilization, which has led to conflicts. Generally speaking, we tend to be nice to those we know, and they are nice to others they know. We are, in essence, friendly and cooperative. 

The conflicts we create stem from how societies have been structured over the last 10,000 years. Throughout recorded history, the hierarchical nature of our societies has contributed to these conflicts. It is not that we are inherently nasty or bad; rather, it is the way we live that has created these problems. 

Pinker and others suggest that systems like democracy distribute power among more people rather than concentrating it in a few, thereby deconstructing hierarchies. As this occurs, we have a greater opportunity to exist without these structures. If it weren't for climate change and the threat of nuclear annihilation, we might continue progressing toward a society resembling one before the establishment of hierarchical institutions that have caused many issues. Unfortunately, climate change poses a significant obstacle, and we face dire consequences.

The more we construct these structures, the more we have an opportunity to exist as we would without them. If it weren't for climate change and the possibility of nuclear annihilation, we would eventually continue on this path of progress. In 100, 200, or even 1,000 years, we might get closer to the way we were before hierarchical institutions created many of our current problems. Unfortunately, climate change will interfere, and we face dire consequences.

In the long term, that's how I perceive things. Steven Pinker has presented this statistically, but I can't recall the specific book. There’s a concept related to "Lord of the Flies," the novel by William Golding. It suggests that if a group of young boys were stranded on an island, they would form two groups that would fight each other and bully others. However, there is no evidence to support this idea. It has fueled the belief that we are inherently in conflict with one another and that, left to our own devices, we would revert to a savage nature. From a psychological perspective, this is not the case.

What we know about life, especially when we consider our personal relationships and those of people we know, shows no evidence that we are generally unpleasant to each other. In fact, we tend to like one another. I consider myself an optimist. 

This reminds me of the time during the fall of Suharto in 1998 when I was living in Yogyakarta. The entire government system collapsed; there was no bureaucracy, and the police and army were nowhere to be seen. In such situations, people often expect chaos and violence, but that was not the case. It was extremely safe, and I never felt unsafe during that time. For at least two years, the police did not appear on the streets at all.

Some might label this as anarchy, predicting that everyone would turn against each other, but that did not happen. While the nature of Indonesian society certainly played a role, the absence of coercive authority does not necessarily lead to people tearing each other apart. This challenges the "Lord of the Flies" notion that we need strict order to prevent chaos.

Some people would say, "Oh, that's anarchy. Everybody's going to kill each other." That didn't happen. Of course, you could argue that this may relate to the nature of societies in Indonesia, and I would certainly say that's a factor. However, the absence of coercive authority doesn't necessarily mean that people will start harming each other. 

There's this whole "Lord of the Flies" notion that we need order, but that's not always the case. There are plenty of places where government completely collapses, and people just shrug their shoulders and get on with it. It's an interesting time. You can present many historical alternatives where there isn't apparent control of law, leading to riots and other issues. 

What you're saying is more pertinent: these events tend to be localized. When it's a global issue, like affecting the whole country, it becomes interesting to see what happens. In Britain, for instance, you rarely see authority on the streets. There isn't a significant police presence, and we're often told that the police aren't very effective at solving crimes. Violent crime is rare in Britain, and I suspect in many countries, it's just not something we typically do to each other. Unless circumstances are extreme, we generally don't act unpleasantly towards one another. 

Why would we? It's much better to cooperate. I need you to do this so I can survive because you provide food or sell food that I can buy. If I harm you, it makes my life harder. Generally speaking, we don't engage in those behaviors. 

I totally agree with that. As humans, we are generally community-minded. We like each other, as you say. It's just that politics and religion, along with other constructs, complicate things. A few power-hungry individuals rise to the top, but they aren't necessarily representative of the general population, which tends to be more cooperative. Those who bubble up to positions of power often thrive on conflict or don't mind it. 

It's the 1% problem. Psychopaths may have had their uses in the past from an evolutionary perspective, but have they outlived their usefulness? Should we lock them up? It is a strange phenomenon, isn't it? While everyone is trying to get along, as you mentioned in Indonesia, we generally follow the rules and are nice to each other. That's always been the case. Thank goodness for that.

Their uses in the past, in evolutionary terms, may have had benefits, but have they outlived their usefulness? Are psychopaths no longer required? Should we lock them up? It is a strange phenomenon, isn't it? While everyone is trying to get on with their lives, like in Indonesia, just doing their thing, what Rupert says is so true. You hardly see any police or state power around. We get on, we follow the rules, and we are generally nice to each other. That has always been the case. Thank God. If that weren't built into our being, we wouldn't exist, for sure.

But what is this phenomenon? We can get entranced by these individuals. We can be mesmerized and seduced into not being so nice to everyone. To some degree, when people are looking for answers to great problems, it's like religion. It provides answers so that you stop questioning. You have ready answers and don't have to think about difficult questions. This is where political psychopaths excel, saying, "We have all the answers; just believe this, and everything will be okay." They encourage you to repeat after them, to say certain things, so you don't need to think anymore. They suggest that thinking is bad and that the more you think, the worse things get. They might have a point to some extent, but that is what it comes down to. 

There are many people who don't want to think; they just want answers given to them. This is what psychopaths prey on. This is the 30% of the population that doesn't want to think and that votes in psychopaths. I wonder if we are becoming vulnerable to these influences as populations. The prevalence of mental health problems at the moment suggests that we have become overly oriented towards thinking. Rather than saying people don't want to think, perhaps we should say they think too much. 

If we were more in our zone, in a kind of flow state, manipulating materials and making things—whether in gardens, forging, or any other activity—we would not be overthinking. We would simply handle things and work with our equipment. The beauty of that state is often found in not thinking. People generally describe that as the most blissful state, almost not thinking but just being in the doing. It is a special kind of doing that is proven to be good for mental health. 

So, it's not that we don't want to think; we don't want troublesome thinking. Troublesome thinking often relates to problems and things not going well. In those moments, I might be open to someone telling me that it will all be alright.

People generally describe the most blissful state as one of not thinking, but simply being in the act of doing. This kind of doing is beneficial for mental health, as it involves handling tasks without the burden of troublesome thoughts. Troublesome thinking often revolves around problems and concerns, leading to a desire for reassurance that everything will be alright. However, we prefer to focus on thoughts that are more positive and promising, envisioning a bright future for ourselves and our country.

There seems to be a decline in manufacturing and the act of creating tangible products. Personal experiences, such as shaping trees or repairing a socket, bring immense pleasure. Achieving something physical, manipulating objects, and using our bodies in this way is fascinating. This notion aligns with my reflections, likely influenced by my readings, about the importance of a whole-body experience.

I have always had a fear of written language and have been more inclined toward physicality and creation. It appears that we engage less in these physical activities, especially as schools place a greater emphasis on literacy. This focus on language is a relatively recent construct in our evolution and societal structure, which may be disadvantageous to mental well-being. Our essential nature involves interacting with the world through manipulation and creation.

Interestingly, I have observed a rise in small institutions dedicated to making things. In Hastings, for example, there are now two successful pottery studios. One, called Mudworks, occupies a former clothing store and offers ceramics courses that are completely oversubscribed. It is remarkable to see so many people eager to spend their money on simply playing with clay.

There are now two very successful, individually focused potteries in Hastings. One is just up the street from us; it used to be a clothing store but is now called Mudworks. People go there for ceramics and pottery courses, which are completely oversubscribed. There's another pottery in Hastings as well. It's amazing that there are people keen on spending their money just to play with bits of clay.

In my work with wood, I volunteer to teach courses that are also sold out. People are interested in manipulating materials, and for many, this is something they haven't had access to before but are eager to try. It's interesting that this interest isn't part of the National Health system, yet people are naturally gravitating towards craft-oriented activities. The idea of manipulating materials seems to resonate deeply.

I've noticed that many of my patients are becoming what I call "super seekers." They feel they must think themselves better, but they often find themselves increasingly distraught. They are centered in their heads, focused on their egoic selves. This egoic being needs to be purified in a Dharma sense. Currently, the mindfulness movement seems to have taken a wrong turn, becoming just another method for super seekers to improve their mind constructs rather than letting go of their beingness. They desperately seek ways to heal and cure themselves, believing that this will lead to a good life.

In my experience, the seeking becomes more manic among the people I work with and those I meet in the mindfulness community. This makes me reflect on our course. When you reached out, Gary, I was intrigued but also a bit confused. There seems to be a fundamental rift: on one hand, we were taught to see the self as less prominent and to explore non-self, which I find appealing. On the other hand, we were encouraged to be more ethical beings. 

If we are still in the seeking business of improving ourselves, what exactly would we improve if there is nothing to improve? I don't think that question has a clear answer. I've looked into Stephen's recent work, but it seems he is still discussing the same themes.

Exploring the concept of non-self, I find it intriguing. On one hand, we must strive to be more ethical beings. However, if there is nothing to improve upon, what exactly are we seeking? I don't believe that question has a definitive answer. I've looked into Stephen's recent work, but it seems he is still focused on the same themes, with ethics as his main driver. 

Who is responsible for instigating positive change? If there is no individual, then who can take action? I see individual well-being as rooted in being present in our bodies, engaging in hands-on activities, and experiencing life fully. When we immerse ourselves in these actions, we become less of an individual. The less of "you" there is, the better. Conversely, the more we identify as individuals, the more challenging our circumstances become. 

If we view ourselves not as isolated individuals but as part of a community, we foster a healthier existence. I have never resonated with Stephen's notion of non-self; I often wonder why we cling to the concept of self. From an ethical standpoint, we typically think that ethics is inherently good, prompting us to strive for greater ethical behavior. However, this implies the existence of a "you" that is acting ethically. 

In reality, humans are likely quite ethical without external structures. As Gary mentioned, if we remove those structures, we still manage to coexist harmoniously. My experience suggests that nothing fundamentally changes when we strip away those layers of imposed ethics. Kindness and unkindness occur naturally, regardless of individual judgments. Many of my patients struggle with harsh self-criticism, feeling inadequate as individuals, which leads to unhappiness.

It's been a pleasure discussing these ideas, but I must mention that we've been talking for two hours. I need to attend to a practical matter—I promised to help my daughter by wiring in her new oven, as she doesn't want to tackle the task herself.

That's all that happens—lots of unhappiness. Yeah, because of harsh judgments. Oh, you're doing me good, you two. Well, it's been lovely. I hate to be the killjoy, but it's been two hours. 

Two hours? Are you sure? Yeah, it is. Well, it says on my... and I'm doing my good deed. I'm doing something physical. I have to go and plug my daughter's oven in. She has just got an oven, and she needs somebody to wire it in for her. And she doesn't want to play an electrician. Of course not. She has a dad. I did say I'd go and do it, so I promised. 

But I've been thinking we left it until Gary comes up with a WhatsApp. We left it a year, and we shouldn't. For me, it's very beneficial to meet you more than once a year. So maybe we should make it at least twice a year and say that we'll meet in no more than six months' time. All it takes is a message. 

Yeah, well, you're the message man, Gary. So I'm relying on you to send a message. Okay, okay. But you send a message. It's February, so it's got to be before the 8th of August. Is that right? Yes. Okay. It has to be before the end of August. Hopefully before then, because I may have some things developing. So yeah, hopefully before then.
